# ReactJS RPG style Game

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f91e579f-1eb8-4870-831f-059c4a5916ff/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/suspicious-yalow-a7e0d7/deploys)

Simple game (just a map for now) working in progress, project created for fun. 
Created from zero, there's collision management and simple talking NPC to interact with.

Needs some refactor, but the idea is there.

Curious how it looks? Check the [demo website](https://suspicious-yalow-a7e0d7.netlify.app/)
